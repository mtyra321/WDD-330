    <h1>Week 1 notes</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Most people use their mobile devices with their thumbs
        </li>
        <li> 44 pixels – minimum target size in order to hit the buttons with the thumb.</li>
        <li>Keep in mind where a user’s thumbs would be when placing app features.</li>
        <li>Make whatever your user is trying to do easy – multiple loading screens bad</li>
        <li>Do one thing and do it well ex: google maps, Gmail, google docs- all only do one thing</li>
        <li>It is really easy to overwhelm people</li>
        <li>you should be able to figure out the app’s purpose with a quick glance</li>
        <li>Don’t hide stuff from the user</li>
        <li>Controls below content- if they reach for a control up top- then they’re hiding content with their reaching thumb</li>
        <li>Get out of the way- don’t show unnecessary screens without telling the user why</li>
        <li> multiple devices per household now that everyone has a phone.</li>
        <li>Making processes automated or less steps. – Nobody wants to click through a bunch of steps that could just be automated by the app or done in less steps.</li>
        <li>Speed matters- the slower your app is, the more business you will lose. People don’t want to wait.</li>
        <li>Removing unused code will make things easier for coders- will allow the app to run less lines of code</li>
        <li>Bottom nav bars are way better that top nav bars- people can’t reach top with thumb</li>
        <li>Less than five percent user complaints- people don’t want to take the time to complain</li>

    </ul>
